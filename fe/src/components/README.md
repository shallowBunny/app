# src/components

The components directory should contain components that may be used across the application.

As a general rule, each component should be placed in its own directory with an accompanying story, unit test, and index file (to handle exports).

Example:

- src/components/ui/Example/
  - Example.tsx
  - Example.stories.tsx
  - Example.test.tsx
  - index.ts
