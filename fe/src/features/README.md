# src/features

The features directory should contain individual features organized by directories. Each directory should mimic the root src directory as needed.

Example:

- src/features/some-feature

  - some-feature/assets
  - some-feature/components
  - some-feature/hooks

- src/features/another-feature

  - another-feature/components
